- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework for Node.js
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Semantic templating language
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Real-time bidirectional event-based communication
- [UUIDv4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4) - Package for generating UUIDs

## Teamwork

Throughout the development process, my friend Utsav and I collaborated closely, dividing tasks efficiently and leveraging each other's strengths. We communicated effectively to ensure smooth integration of features and maintained a cohesive workflow to achieve our project goals.
